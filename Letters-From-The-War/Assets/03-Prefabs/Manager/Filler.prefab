  - content: I hope you are not alarmed, you should not be. Differently from the
      previous months, these days the front is calm, the weather is nice and we have
      food and water. Sometimes I have irrational panic after William died unexpectedly.
      They even told us that we will have a small truce this summer for the Assumption.
      I would just like to come back home and hug you all.
  - content: "Life at the east front is safe, but worrying. We are currently not
      fighting because we are out of resources, but we move back each day to flee
      from the Russian army and I fear they are moving forward our borders. Peter
      has some spare coffee; we drink that together to ease the nerves. When I drink
      something hot looking at the sun setting, it always reminds me of us just a
      few years ago. I miss those times before the war; now I can\u2019t spend a
      day without thinking that if we fail, we will bring the enemy's army to our
      front door. I can\u2019t wait to see you again."
  - content: "Really thanks for your letter. I am happy to know that you and mom
      are well despite everything. You even remembered to water my rosemary; I hope
      its scent could remind you a little bit of myself. If I will be back I will
      thank you for taking care of my stuff. A few days ago, during a retreat, we
      ran into a minefield. I don\u2019t even have to tell you that it was not signaled.
      It was a massacre: ten of us couldn\u2019t make it out alive and the other
      five got injured because of an explosion. Now I got treated and I feel better.
      Sergeant Hyam told us that it won\u2019t happen again and that we are safe
      now\u2026 I hope he is right. I love you and tell mom I can\u2019t wait to
      see her again."
  - content: Thanks awfully for your letter. I am glad Professor Parker could continue
      his research without the help of his students. I am just sad that I could not
      continue my academic career because of this war. Professor Parker's company
      was charming with all that knowledge he could exchange so easily nevertheless
      so wisely; compared to that, the individual that goes by the name of Corporal
      Giles is an obnoxious presence. We spent the last weeks walking through the
      French territory to come back home. We are all tired because we do not eat
      nor sleep enough; all that unbearable corporal does is scream in the face of
      the privates that have the misfortune not to keep pace. I just want to go back
      to my studies and my old life.
  - content: 'I expect you are wondering why I have not written, but it was a difficult
      time. I am really thankful for your kind words; I needed to hear something
      like that. We have been under fire for three months now and we are in awful
      conditions compared to when we left. I heard rumors that at the other front,
      where Daniel is, they are doing a little bit better than us; they are retreating,
      but at least they are alive. Here we lost almost every man: we were almost
      three hundred defending the position and now we are way less than two hundred.
      About a half. I do not think we will resist for much longer. This may be my
      last letter to you.'
  - content: "I am writing to you in despair. I do not know which information is
      coming from the front but we really had no chance against the enemy\u2019s
      army. I hope this letter will reach you before them. You have to leave the
      country right now. I am out of danger and I will reach a safe place soon. Just
      do as I said and we will rejoin after the war."
  - content: Yesterday I had to visit all the units again, to get statements for
      my monthly report. Every time I checked, we had lost a sheer amount of soldiers.
      Nevertheless, we did not have enough ammunition and food to move somewhere.
      They really had low morale, but I did not expect something like this; as soon
      as I arrived at the camp, everyone was gone, even the officers! Deserters!
      I will be home in a few days. Here I am done with my job. I wish you and our
      kids all the best. We will hug soon.
